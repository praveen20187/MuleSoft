Anypoint Platform supports the following types of environments:
===================================================================

Production environments: provides a production environment where you can deploy applications and APIs publicly. When you create a
new Anypoint Platform account, by default it contains one production environment.

Sandbox environment: provide useful environments for development and testing. By default, Anypoint Platform accounts are created with 
one sandbox environment with one vCore assigned to it.

Sandbox environments enable you to safely test an application without affecting the production environment. For example, you can create 
a sandbox environment for a QA team where they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment. This helps to secure your production environment and eliminate the risk of a developer accidentally changing an application in production. After you are sure an application is safe to expose to users, you can easily promote the application from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

Design environment: enables you to test and run applications at design time. This environment is used by the Design Center application. 
By default, a new Anypoint Platform account contains one design environment with one vCore assigned to it.
